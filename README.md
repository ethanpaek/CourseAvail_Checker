# CourseAvail Checker

This Python script sends me an SMS text message as soon as a class on CourseAvail (Santa Clara University's class availbility website) fills up. This is completed through the use of Twilio API in order to send texts to my phone and Windows Task Manager to continuously check a certain class's availability.
